# Intro section with dropdown navigation

## My Process
This project was built entirely with React. The application is comprised of one stateful class component and five stateless components. I designed a method on the main component that changes the visibility of the mobile menu and the two dropdown menus when a button is clicked using state properties. The project allowed me to review the usage of absolute and relative positions and implement the \<picture\> tag that I recently learned.
